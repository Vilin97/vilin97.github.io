## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington, working with [Jingwei Hu](https://jingweihu-math.github.io/webpage/). I am the deputy director of the [UW Math AI Lab](https://sites.math.washington.edu/ai/) and I organize the [UW Math AI Seminar](https://math.washington.edu/events/series/math-ai-seminar).

I grew up in Russia before moving to Boston in 2015 for undergrad. Initially pursuing economics, I switched to mathematics and graduated in 2019, followed by a Master's in computer science in 2020. I began my PhD at the University of Washington in algebraic topology, then pivoted to applied mathematics in 2022 after an internship at Google. My current research focuses on deep learning and interacting particle systems applied to plasma modeling and sampling problems.

## Research Interests

- **Scientific computing:** solve high-dimensional PDEs using interacting particle systems and neural networks.
- **Math formalization:** accelerate mathematics research with Lean and AI.
